<h1>Tanner's Favourite Films</h1>
<h2>My top 5 films of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>InterStellar</h3>
<p>Perfect Sci-fi film and the Hans Zimmer music pulls it all together. Still yet to watch without crying.</p>
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>A reminder that anyone can accomplish anything. A message to not take life too seriously but jump at every opportunity.</p>
<h3>Rocky/Rocky Balbao</h3>
<p>Had to involve one of these classics, inspiring story; a reminder to never make excuses and persevere.</p>
<h3>Avengers Infity War/Endgame</h3>
<p>Incredible setup through a ten year cinematic universe. The first time the vilian wins in Infinity War. My childhood in a nutshell, incredibly quotable.</p>
<h3>Hot Fuzz</h3>
<p>Visual Comedy from Edgar Wright just can't be beaten. Asbolute classic film and the best of the trilogy.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Honerable Mention.</h2>
<h3>About Time</h3>
<p>Always gets me in the feels when his dad dies. Great message about seizing the moment and letting go of the uncontrollable (even if it seems to be in your control)</p>
